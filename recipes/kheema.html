   <p></p>
   <h4>Ingredients</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable, canola, or sunflower oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 tablespoons garam masala</li>
      <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef, or any other ground meat</li>
      <li>2 medium tomatoes, finely chopped</li>

      <li>1.4 cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish</li>
   </ul>
   <p></p>
   <h4>Steps to Make it</h4>
   <ol>
      <li>Heat the cooking oil in a wok or deep pan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add the cumin seeds and fry for 1 minute or until the seeds stop spluttering.</li>
      <li>Add onions and saute till they turn a pale golden color, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the garlic and ginger pastes and fry 1 minute to get rid of the "raw" fragrance.</li>
      <li>Add the coriander, cumin, garam masala, and salt to taste and sauté,
         stirring almost continuously, until the oil begins to separate from the masala. 
         (When this happens, you know the spices are cooked to perfection.)</li>
      <li>Add the meat to the masala and sauté until browned, stirring often to prevent burning— about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the tomatoes, stir, and cook until they are soft.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat, add the lime or lemon juice, and stir to mix well.</li>
      <li>Garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve hot.</li>
   </ol>
